                    I have good communication skills thanks to participating in group activities for assignments and projects in my courses as well as in the club I have joined.
                    I can speak, listen, and write English at an intermediate level.

                    I have always strived to develop myself by learning new things. 
                    After 5 years of practicing taekwondo, I earned a black belt in 3 years and won a bronze medal at the Open City Tournament. 
                    I have also learned other skills, such as playing the guitar and drawing, through self-study

                    Living in Vung Tau for 18 years and moving to Ho Chi Minh City for university has enhanced my adaptability. 
                    The shift from high school to university helped me quickly adjust my study methods, and I believe I can apply this skill to my work.

                <p>
                    My university assignments and martial arts club activities require teamwork, responsibility, and collaboration. 
                    As a third-year student and vice president of the taekwondo club, I have worked with many groups, 
                    developing strong teamwork skills that I am confident will help me succeed in group projects.

            <p>
                My name is Lê Mạnh Đan, 20 years old. 
                I was born and raised in Vung Tau and am currently living and working in Ho Chi Minh City. 
                I am a third-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology at the Vietnam Aviation Academy. 
                I am also the vice president of the Taekwondo club at my school. To further develop myself and gain practical work experience, I am seeking an internship position.

                Although my expertise in the field of Information Technology is still limited, 
                my strength lies in front-end web development, I have a strong understanding and grasp of basic programming concepts.
                And i am always determined and persistent in striving to improve and develop myself in this field.

                    <p>
                        Most companies hiring for programming positions require knowledge of APIs, which was not taught in my university. 
                        So, I self-studied and learned the basics. 
                        I developed a website that checks the weather by city name, using the OpenWeatherMap API.

                        The system also supports garbage collection booking for households. 
                        I developed this product with backend support from ChatGPT and managed the database using Firebase.

                        This is a product I created for personal purposes, 
                        aiming to explore and learn how to build and develop the backend using Firebase for database storage and management,

                        and Vercel for web deployment.Since this product is for learning and exploration, it's not fully polished. 
                        I use it as a platform to apply various support services, design approaches, and my own ideas for the interface and functionality.
